# CAMHD Metadata
Undergraduate students at Rutgers University have used still frames extracted from the HD Video camera (CAMHD) to compile time-lapse videos of the hydrothermal vent, under the direction of the OOI Data Team. There are 7 biological scenes of interest, captured during the pan/zoom routine of each video. The students are helping produce metadata, stored in this repository, by time-stamping each scene of interest in every video file on the archive.

Since 2016-06-28, CAMHD has been recording the timing of scenes in automatically produced metadata file, which can be identified on the raw data archive (see link below) but the .log extension. For video files prior to 2016-06-28, the students are reproducing metadata, which is being stored in this archive.
