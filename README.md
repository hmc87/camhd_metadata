# CAMHD Metadata
There are 8 scenes of scientific interest being recorded at different zoom levels during the daily automated CAMHD pan/zoom sequences. Students at Rutgers University, under the supervision of the OOI Data Team, are helping produce metadata by time-stamping each scene of interest and storing this information in csv files in this repository. 

Since 2016-06-28, metadata creation has been automated and can be found on the raw data archive (see link below) in the .log files. For video files prior to 2016-06-28, metadata on the timing of scenes is being manually compiled and made available here via csv.
